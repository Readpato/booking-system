# bookingSystem

Project where I build a booking system for a restaurant.

Booking System Project:

How will the background of the page look?
-The background of the page will consist on a gradient background that will have a glass window infront of it that's blurred.

Where will be the booking added from?

The booking will be added from a side panel where you can choose:

-Name from the person / Input Text
-How many people will they be / Input Number
-Hour of the booking / Input hour? Number?
-Cellphone for contact / Input number? with RegEx for cellphone.

Once the booking is made, it's going to appear on the right side of the booking panel.

-The booking panel will be headed with a title saying the reservations from the day.
-Then, right underneath it, the booking's list is going to be divided into four parts by hour.

Responsiveness:
-Once one part of the booking hour part is filled with X clients, it gets blocked and it cannot take any more bookings.
-A booking has a trash/X button at the end of it to cancel if the client cancels the booking.
-Once the day starts over, the booking panel will reset. Maybe add a button that can also reset?
